# Generic CFW
A "CFW" for the original 3DS, without all the nasty branding. Based on rxTools.

__Features:__

* All the normal features you'd expect of a "CFW"
* A familiar "tools" menu with many useful options
* It's not literally a billboard advertising the developer
* Set the "Ver. " string text to anything you like

And more once I come up with something
